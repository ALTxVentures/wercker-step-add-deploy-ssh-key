  Wercker allows you to generate SSH keys and expose them as via
  environment variables to your build or deployment pipeline.
  This step can be used to write these values to an identity file
  and use ssh-add to add the new identitie to the authentication
  agent, ssh-agent.

  This step is created especially to streamline the use of
  Capistrano deployment with deploy_via set to :remote_copy, 
  :export, or :checkout.
